## 1. Brief Summary

The Undergraduate Research Conference at UNC is a research conference for undergraduates, by undergraduates. Recognizing a disparity in professional development opportunities for Southern students to present and develop research communication, we have founded this conference to provide those avenues in NC and beyond.

The URC will take place from October 2–3, 2026 on the University's campus with a planned 200 attendees. At the URC, undergraduates with accepted abstracts will present their research at one of several poster sessions organized by broad disciplines including STEM, social sciences, and the humanities. About 20–30 selected undergraduates will present 15-minute oral talks of their research throughout the event. We plan to provide financial merit awards to the best poster presentation and oral presentation, judged by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate seniors pursuing an honors thesis.

Beyond research presentations, we plan to include professional development seminars led by career development staff and competitive research communication awards prioritizing federally threatened research fields (public health, social sciences, and minoritized-disparity focused work). To fund this conference, we will apply for funding through The Parents Council, the Y Fund by the Campus Y, the UNC Student Government, and sponsorships by research companies in North Carolina.

## 2. Our Goals

The Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) aims to:

1. Expand access to professional research presentation opportunities for Southern undergraduates
2. Strengthen students' scientific communication and career readiness
3. Build a sustainable, student-led model for interdisciplinary collaboration

By hosting 200 attendees for poster and oral sessions, professional workshops, and awards in diverse research fields, the URC provides equitable opportunities to share and celebrate undergraduate research.

In the long term, the URC will establish a recurring, inclusive platform that enhances UNC's reputation as a hub for undergraduate research excellence and accessibility across the region.
